 Business Overview/Problem

LuxuryStay Hotel currently lacks a comprehensive understanding of its diverse customer base, limiting its ability to tailor services, marketing strategies, and operational processes to meet the unique needs and preferences of individual guests. The hotel seeks to address the following challenges:

 

    ✓ Limited Customer Insight: LuxuryStay Hotel struggles to obtain a detailed understanding of its customers' preferences, booking behaviors, and unique requirements. As a result, it is challenging to offer personalized services and experiences that match the diverse expectations of guests.
    ✓ Suboptimal Marketing and Upselling: The hotel currently employs generic marketing campaigns and offers, which may not effectively resonate with individual guest segments. This leads to missed opportunities for upselling, cross-selling, and enhancing overall revenue.
    ✓ Limited Guest Loyalty Strategies: The absence of in-depth customer profiling hinders the development and implementation of effective guest loyalty programs. The hotel seeks to enhance guest loyalty and increase the rate of returning guests

Rationale for the Project

    In the context of the hotel business, customer profiling involves collecting and analyzing data to understand the specific needs, preferences, and behaviors of individual guests or groups of guests. This information is used to categorize guests into segments, allowing the hotel to tailor its services, marketing strategies, and operational processes to better meet the unique requirements of each segment.

     

    By categorizing customer behavior and preferences, they can:
        ✓ Enhanced Personalization: By segmenting customers based on their unique characteristics, preferences, and booking behaviors, Luxury Stay Hotel can personalize services, offers, and experiences to match the distinct needs of each segment.
        ✓ Improved Marketing Effectiveness: Machine learning-based customer segmentation enables the creation of targeted marketing campaigns. These campaigns can be customized to appeal to the specific interests and needs of each segment.
        ✓ Reduce Abandonment: Decrease the abandonment rate of booking reservations by understanding why potential guests abandon the booking process. 

     

Aim of the Project

The primary aim of this project is to create comprehensive and accurate customer profiles for LuxuryStay Hotels by harnessing the power of historical data analysis. These profiles will encompass critical aspects such as demographics, booking history, preferences, and feedback, enabling the hotel chain to gain a deeper understanding of its guests. This deeper understanding will, in turn, empower LuxuryStay Hotels to deliver highly personalized services, enhance guest satisfaction, and optimize revenue generation.

 

Major objectives are listed below:

    ✓ Data collection and analysis: This objective involves gathering data from various sources within LuxuryStay Hotels, ensuring data quality and consistency. It includes cleaning, validating, and preparing the data for analysis.
    ✓ Dimensionality reduction: The aim here is to reduce the complexity of the data while retaining relevant information.
    ✓ Data modelling with unsupervised machine learning: This objective involves applying unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as clustering and dimensionality reduction, to uncover patterns and insights within the data.
    ✓ Customer profiling and analysis: The final objective is to create comprehensive customer profiles that encompass demographics, preferences, behaviors, and feedback

Project Scope

    ✓ Exploratory Data Analysis: The data is thoroughly explored and analysed to gain insights and understand its characteristics. This involves statistical analysis, data visualization, and other exploratory techniques to identify patterns, correlations, anomalies, and potential issues in the data.
    ✓ Feature Selection (and Engineering): Not all features provided in data may be of relevance to the target. Feature selection is the process by which we can select the most appropriate of these according to a specified set of criteria. The data features might also be composable to give more informative features.
    ✓ Model Development: Various modelling techniques are applied to the prepared data in this stage to build predictive or descriptive models. This can include machine learning algorithms, statistical models, or other analytical approaches. The models are trained, validated, and fine-tuned to optimize their performance.
    ✓ Model Evaluation and Selection: Once the models are developed, they are evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics and validation techniques. This involves assessing their performance, generalizability, and robustness. The best-performing model(s) are selected for further deployment or refinement, and attempts to explain why they work and what they learn are made.
