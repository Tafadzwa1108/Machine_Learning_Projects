<h1 align="left">About the Dataset</h1>
<p align="left">The dataset was sourced from Kaggle.</p>

<h1 align="left">Tech Stack</h1>
<p>Programming Language: Python</p>
<p>Libraries and Frameworks:</p>
<ul>
    <li>NumPy</li>
    <li>Pandas</li>
    <li>Matplotlib</li>
    <li>Seaborn</li>
    <li>Scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics)</li>
</ul>

<h1 align="left">Model Evaluation</h1>
<p>To evaluate the performance of the logistic regression model, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was used. MAE measures the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. It is calculated as the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values. In this context, MAE provided a straightforward metric to understand the prediction accuracy of the model.</p>

<h1 align="left">Medical Data for Insurance Cost Prediction</h1>
<p>By applying regression algorithms, the model aimed to predict the cost of insurance based on various medical features, helping insurance companies better understand and forecast potential costs based on client health data.</p>
