<h1 align="left"> Business Overview/Problem</h1>
<p align="left">
  
     A. Customer Churn: Customer retention is a significant challenge in the banking industry. Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. High customer churn rates can lead to a loss of deposits and revenue.
     
    B. Personalization: BankTrust must provide personalized experiences to meet the diverse needs of their customers. Failing to do so can result in customers seeking alternative banks that offer tailored services and products.
     
    C. Marketing Efficiency: Inefficient marketing campaigns can lead to high customer acquisition costs and low return on investment. BankTrust need to optimize their marketing strategies to target the right customers with relevant offers.

<h1 align="left"> Project Rationale </h1>
<p align="left">
    RFM stands for Recency, Frequency and Monetary. It is a data-driven technique used to segment customers based on their past behaviours.
 
        A. RFM analysis can help BankTrust segment their customer base effectively. By categorizing customers based on their transaction Recency (how recently they engaged with the bank), Frequency (how often they conduct transactions), and Monetary value (the total value of their transactions), BankTrust can identify different customer segments. This segmentation allows for more targeted marketing and service strategies.
         
        B. RFM analysis can help BankTrust identify customers who have become less active (lower frequency) or have not engaged with the bank recently (lower recency). Recognizing these signs early will enable BankTrust to implement retention strategies to prevent customer churn, such as offering personalized promotions or contacting customers with special offers.
         
        C. RFM analysis helps BankTrust optimize their marketing efforts. Instead of using a one-size-fits-all approach, BankTrust can tailor their marketing campaigns to target specific customer segments with offers that are most likely to resonate. This reduces marketing costs and increases the return on investment (ROI) for marketing campaigns.

<h1 align="left"> Aim Of The Project</h1>
<p align="left">
 The primary objective of this project is to enhance the banking industry's customer relationship management by implementing an RFM-based customer segmentation approach. 

This entails leveraging transaction history, recency, frequency, and monetary value as critical customer behavior attributes to categorize clients into meaningful segments. Furthermore, the project aims to employ advanced unsupervised learning techniques to uncover hidden patterns and structures within the customer data, ultimately yielding a comprehensive set of distinct customer clusters.

Through the application of RFM analysis and unsupervised learning, the project aims to unlock valuable insights that will empower the bank to offer tailored solutions, strengthen customer relationships, and drive sustainable growth in a competitive market environment.

<h1 align="left">About The Dataset </h1>
<p>
 
    ✓ TransactionID: A unique identifier for each individual transaction, allowing for precise tracking and reference.
    ✓ CustomerID: A distinct identifier assigned to each customer, enabling the association of transactions with specific individuals.
    ✓ CustomerDOB: The date of birth of the customer, providing insights into their age and potentially influencing financial behavior.
    ✓ CustGender: The gender of the customer.
    ✓ CustLocation: The location or geographical information associated with the customer, which can offer insights into regional trends and behavior.
    ✓ CustAccountBalance: The current balance in the customer's account, serving as a critical financial indicator for analysis.
    ✓ TransactionDate: The date on which a transaction occurred.
    ✓ TransactionTime: A Unix timestamp representing the precise time of a transaction.
    ✓ TransactionAmount: The monetary value of the transaction, indicating the financial magnitude of each transaction and facilitating analysis of spending or deposit habits.

<h1>Project Scope </h1>
<p>
    
    A. Exploratory Data Analysis: The data is thoroughly explored and analysed to gain insights and understand its characteristics. This involves statistical analysis, data visualization, and other exploratory techniques to identify patterns, correlations, anomalies, and potential issues in the data.
     
    B. Feature Selection (and Engineering): Not all features provided in data may be of relevance to the target. Feature selection is the process by which we can select the most appropriate of these according to a specified set of criteria. The data features might also be composable to give more informative features.
     
    C. Model Development: Various modelling techniques are applied to the prepared data in this stage to build predictive or descriptive models. This can include machine learning algorithms, statistical models, or other analytical approaches. The models are trained, validated, and fine-tuned to optimize their performance.
     
    D. Model Evaluation and Selection: Once the models are developed, they are evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics and validation techniques. This involves assessing their performance, generalizability, and robustness. The best-performing model(s) are selected for further deployment or refinement, and attempts to explain why they work and what they learn are made.
