<h1 align="left">Business Problem Overview</h1>
<p align="left">

PharmaCorp faces a significant business challenge related to the optimization of its pharmaceutical supply chain inventory.

    A. Overproduction and Losses: PharmaCorp often produces medications in quantities that exceed market demand. This overproduction leads to substantial financial losses due to expired shelf-life and the need for disposal of unsold products.
     
    B. Shelf Life Management: Managing the varying shelf lives of different pharmaceutical products is a complex task. Failure to sell products before their expiration date not only results in financial losses but also poses potential risks to patient safety.
     
    C. Market Trends: The pharmaceutical industry is highly dynamic, with market trends and demand patterns constantly evolving. PharmaCorp struggles to align its production schedules with these ever-changing market dynamics.
    
    D. Competitive Pressures: PharmaCorp faces intense competition from other pharmaceutical companies. Efficient inventory management is crucial to maintaining a competitive edge and optimizing costs.</p>
  
 
<h1 align="left"> Project Rationale </h1>
<p align="left">
    Supply Chain Inventory Optimization is the process of managing inventory levels in a supply chain to minimize costs while meeting customer demand. It is crucial in the pharmaceutical industry because of the perishable nature of drugs and the need to maintain a high level of quality control. The significance of initiating this project lies in several compelling reasons:
         
        A. Cost Reduction: PharmaCorp incurs significant financial losses due to overproduction and inventory mismanagement. Optimizing inventory based on shelf life and market trends can lead to substantial cost reductions.
         
        B. Enhanced Profitability: Reducing losses from overproduction and minimizing waste will directly impact PharmaCorp's profitability, allowing resources to be allocated more efficiently.
         
        C. Competitive Advantage: Efficient inventory management will provide PharmaCorp with a competitive advantage by allowing the company to respond more effectively to market trends and customer demands.
         
        D. Sustainability: Reducing overproduction and waste aligns with PharmaCorp's commitment to sustainability and responsible business practices.
