<h1 align="center">Space Rocket Company</h1>

Welcome to the Space Rocket Company Project! In this project, we delve into the commercial space industry, focusing on the competitive landscape, particularly SpaceX, and aim to provide insights that will aid Space Y, a new rocket company, in determining launch prices and predicting the reuse of first stages.
Project Scenario:

With the commercial space age underway, companies like Virgin Galactic, Rocket Lab, Blue Origin, and notably SpaceX, have been making significant strides in making space travel more accessible and cost-effective. SpaceX, in particular, stands out with its remarkable achievements, including sending spacecraft to the International Space Station, deploying the Starlink satellite internet constellation, and conducting manned missions to space.
 
 <h2>Objectives:</h2>

 <li>Determining Launch Prices: Understanding the cost structure of SpaceX launches compared to other providers by analyzing factors such as rocket reusability.</li>
 <li> Predicting First Stage Reuse: Developing a machine learning model to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage based on public information and mission parameters.</li>
 <li>Creating Dashboards: Generating informative dashboards to visualize key insights and trends for Space Y's team to make informed decisions.</li>
       
<h2>Data Sources:</h2>
<li>Publicly available data on SpaceX launches, including mission details, launch outcomes, and cost information.</li>
<li>Information on rocket specifications, including the Falcon 9 and its stages.</li>
<li>Research articles, news reports, and industry publications on commercial spaceflight.</li>

  
<h2>Tools and Technologies:</h2>
  <li>Programming Languages: Python for data analysis and machine learning</li>
  <li> Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning</li>
  <li>Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn for creating informative visualizations.</li>
  <li>GitHub: Version control and collaboration for project development.</li>
  <li>Jupyter Notebooks: Interactive development and documentation of analysis processes.</li>
    
 
<h2>Project Structure:</h2>
  <li>Data Collection: Gathering and preprocessing data from various sources</li>
  <li>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring and visualizing the data to understand patterns and insights</li>
  <li>Model Training: Building and training machine learning models for predicting first stage reuse</li>
   <li>Dashboard Creation: Designing interactive dashboards to present key findings and insights</li>
  <li>Documentation: Writing comprehensive documentation and reports to summarize the project findings and methodologies.</li>
