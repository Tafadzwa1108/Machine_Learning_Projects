<h1 align="left">Business Problem Overview</h1>
<p align="left">
GreenSeason Farms faces a critical business challenge related to optimizing harvest schedules and distribution. The primary issues the company encounters include:

    ✓ Inefficient Harvesting: The current harvesting process is primarily based on traditional seasonal patterns and historical data, resulting in inefficiencies. This approach leads to underutilization of resources during peak seasons and overproduction during off-peak times.
    ✓ Demand Variability: The demand for agricultural products fluctuates due to factors such as weather conditions, consumer preferences, and market trends. GreenHarvest Farms often struggles to accurately predict these variations, leading to issues with overstocking or understocking products.
    ✓ Shelf Life Management: Different crops have varying shelf lives, and ensuring products reach customers at their peak freshness is a challenge. Misjudging harvest times can lead to product wastage and reduced profits.
    ✓ Transportation Optimization: The distribution network encompasses multiple destinations across the country. Finding the optimal routes and delivery schedules to minimize transportation costs while meeting demand is a complex problem.

<h1 align="left"> Project Rationale </h1>
<p align="left">
Production Distribution Forecasting is a data science technique that helps farmers predict the optimal time to harvest their crops. The significance of initiating the Agricultural Product Distribution Forecasting project at GreenSeason Farms is underscored by several compelling reasons:
 
        ✓ Enhancing Efficiency: Accurate demand forecasting and optimized harvest schedules will maximize resource utilization, leading to increased operational efficiency and cost savings.
        ✓ Reducing Food Waste: By better predicting demand and harvest times, GreenHarvest Farms can significantly reduce food waste, aligning with sustainability goals and minimizing environmental impact.
        ✓ Improved Profit Margins: Efficient distribution, reduced wastage and meeting customer demand, translate into improved profit margins for the company.
        ✓ Competitive Advantage: Staying ahead of market demand trends and consistently delivering fresh produce will give GreenSeason Farms a competitive edge in the industry.
